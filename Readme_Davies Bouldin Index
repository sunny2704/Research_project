Summation of mean value of points in cluster Ck to its barycenter 𝐺^{𝑘}  and Ck’ to its barycenter 𝐺^{𝑘′}  divided by distance between the barycenters
The Mean value of the maximum of the above value among all the clusters is the Davies-Bouldin Index.
The lower the value, the better clustering it is
