Refer to the presentation in the master branch for more details.

This index is given as the ratio of the weighted sum of the squared distances between the 𝐺^{𝑘}  and G, the weight being the number nk of elements in the cluster Ck and the sum of the squared distances between the observations 𝑀^{𝑘}   i and the barycenter 𝐺^{𝑘}  of the cluster.
This is divided by the ratio of number of cluster subtracted from total number of clusters divided by one less than total number of clusters.
The bigger the index value, the better is the clustering.
