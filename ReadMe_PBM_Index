This index is the square of the largest distance between two barycenters multiplied by the ratio of the sum of the distances of all the points to the barycenter G of the entire data set and the sum of the distances of the points of each cluster to their barycenter divided by the number of clusters.
The bigger the value, better is the cluster validation.
